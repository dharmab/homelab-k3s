# Alertmanager

[Alertmanager](https://www.prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager) provides alerting capabilities for the Prometheus monitoring stack. It queries Prometheus to see if any configured alert rules should be triggered, and sends notifications through external services such as [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/).
